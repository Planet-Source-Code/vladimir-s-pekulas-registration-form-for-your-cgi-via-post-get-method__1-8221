Hey,
this app was not intended as a stand alone, but as a final
touch to your app.
What does it do ? Well, it's able to conect to your .cgi script
and fill out the form. Could be used for databse or anything in that
direction.
It's currently set-up to connect to FormMail.cgi script (by Math Wrigth)
which will then email you the information.
Works fine with both POST and GET methods.

Have fun.
